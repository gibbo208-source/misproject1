            <p>My initial plan was to attend UWS after finishing my two years at LSC (a local community college). I thought that I would be unable to afford UMD tuition and it seemed like a suitable alternative. After applying to UMD on a whim, being accepted, and offered a sizable scholarship amount, I decided to attend my local university. UMD offers a wide range of majors in fields I am interested in and is rated well in comparison to other state universities in the region.</p>

                    I am a Duluth native. Duluth is an interesting city as it is both industrial and has a large tourism industry. Although the winters are tough, there are a multitude of fun activities for all seasons: skiing, snowboarding, hiking, snowshoeing, tubing, and many more outdoor activities are easily accessible throughout the metro area.

                <p>
                    UMD is a mid-sized campus with many modern amenities. The educational institution has been built upon for almost a century, and as such is somewhat labyrinthine. There is a large dining hall in addition to a food court. There are numerous clubs for almost all interests and lifestyles. During the winter, there is little need to go outside as all of the major buildings are interconnected through corridors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, both Duluth and UMD may seem like nothing special at first glance, but are ultimately the jewel of the upper midwest.

                    My interest in philosophy and 19th-century literature reflects a desire to understand 
                    human nature and the complexities of thought. These subjects provide intellectual 
                    stimulation and help me approach problems from multiple perspectives.

                    Looking ahead, I aim to leverage my MIS education to advance in technology-focused roles 
                    while maintaining the practical, hands-on approach that has served me well in maintenance 
                    and property management.
