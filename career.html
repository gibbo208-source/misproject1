            <p>
                I have worked the same job for five years. My family owns an apartment complex and managing it has allowed me to become proficient in many important skills. These include:

                <p>
                    Before working for the family business, I was employed by FedEx for a short period as a package handler. I decided to quit as I believed my time was better spent helping my aging father.

                <p>
                    Outside of work, I have volunteered for a few charitable organizations, mostly related to Christianity. First, I have worked at soup kitchens with a local Lutheran church and have been all the better for it.

                    My ideal career is one which can be worked remotely. This is why I chose to major in MIS after some lengthy deliberation. Being both a traveller and a person deeply interested by and entrenched in technology, there are numerous positions I would be able to fill (although IT is my primary choice at the moment.) Some companies which I would enjoy working for are: Cirrus, Phillip Morris, or Nestle.

                    <p><strong>Cirrus:</strong> a local company that specializes in aircraft production and innovation. Working for them could prove a challenging yet rewarding experience by providing the local community with quality service and efficient work.<br/>

                    <p><strong>Phillip Morris:</strong> Much has been said about the tobacco industry, most of it negative. However, I think the future looks bright for this hallmark of industry as it expands to emerging markets and nicotine consumption takes new, less dangerous forms.<br/>

                    <p><strong>Nestle:</strong> Nestle is one of the largest food manufacturers and distributors in the world. As a personal consumer of their products and their all-encompassing portfolio, to become a small part of that would be rewarding.<br/>
